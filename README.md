# getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project submit

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. 

To reproduce the cleaning and transformation the following steps must be performed:

1. set working directory to root folder of UCI HAR Dataset
2. download and run run_analysis.R are sourced
3. the rest of the script is sourced

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Download the dataset
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
1. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set
1. The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
